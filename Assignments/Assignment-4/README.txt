# Question 2:
I downloaded the excel spreadsheet and it opened with LibraOffice and then I deleted the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th and 12th columns. I then saved the file in my Assignment 4 folder as as .csv file. I tried to write a ipython notebook but the file caused
an error and said it could not be opened. I have not previously been exposed to python or any type of programming so I tried my best with this assignment and I would like to explain what I tried to do in my code. I tried my best and I hope part marks can be awarded 
because this assignment took a lot of time and effort and I tried to get help from individuals and tried to look for a tutor or someone to help but everyone was too busy with prepping for exams, as was I. 
In my pytohn file I used the code given from part A) to create a map of the world, and created my title for every different map that you asked for in part C. As far as I am aware, my points did not show up on my map because the file could not be read. I'm sure
there could be some other errors. In my python file, I created three lists. The first list, diseases, gathered all of the disease names from the original file (i.e. measles, mumps, polio, etc.). I then made two more lists, one taking the numbers from the file that 
referred to latitude (i.e. 5 columns over) and the other for longitutde. This way I then made a function that when I searched for the word I wanted (i.e. Measles) in the diseases list, that it would print the corresponding columns from both the latitude and 
longitude list. Then, it would print a circle (where I just chose the markersize because I did not know how to create a formula for the radius size) and it would print on the map. 
I understand the concepts I just sometimes have trouble creating these functions and using loops and tampering with simple pieces of code to do what I want with them. 

Overall I think the assignment was the hardest one yet, and it was given to us at a stressful time in the semester (i.e. right before exams). I think it is unfair because I had to take time away from studying from my exam to try and find someone to help me with this assignment. I think it was more difficult for individuals who have not been exposed as much to python programming (i.e. math/physics/chem/any other students than CSCI) and it was tough to find someone to help to explain these concepts. I didn't come to office hours but there were times when I had so much to do that it made coming to office hours impossible. I hope you take these things into consideration when marking all of the assignments. Thank you.
